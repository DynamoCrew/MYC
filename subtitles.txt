On August 15th, 2023,hundreds of police officers
launched pre-dawn raids across Singapore.So far, ten persons have been arrested
and charged.They are being accused of launderinggains from organized crime.This was a big news story just
by the sheer amount of assets involved.Cryptocurrencies, luxury
watches, luxury cars.Luxury bags, homes, pieces of jewelry.It has now become the biggest money
laundering case in Singapore's history.It equals to about $2 billion.For decades, the Asian city has welcomed
foreign money, resulting in itbecoming one of the wealthiest countries
on the planet.But beyond all the legitimate investment,
Singapore's opennessis now under scrutiny.In the latest case for attracting billions
of dollars of allegedly dirty money,some of it even funneled
through the world's biggest banks.This is drawing the attention on
to the kind of loopholes that potentiallyhave allowed this massive amount of wealth
to have been accumulated.The origin of the accused has also shone
a light on global money flowsand whether Singapore has done enough
to police them.The suspects are all from
China or have links to China.Singapore is a small country.It is an economy that cannot sustain
domestic consumptionthe way bigger countries like
 China or the US can.And that's why investments are critical
to Singapore's growth.There's great ease in living
and staying here, especially for expats.Singapore has long capitalized on
its reputation to attract the global rich.Crime is low, politics stable,and banks welcoming.Wealth flows into Singapore totaled $1.5
trillion in 2022.In terms of assets parked in Singapore,it is the third largest
only after Switzerland and Hong Kong.But this flood of moneyhas also come with downsides
as the country has become more affluent.Skyrocketing prices
and growing wealth inequalityhave become contentious issues
in the city-state.If we look at polls right now,
some of the top issuesthat people mention
is the problem of housing affordability.Singapore is the most expensive city
in the world to own a car.There is a danger that this resentment
and unhappinessstarts to be conflated with the issue
of a lot of these foreigners coming in.A sizable amount of the money coming into
Singapore is from China.Since 2019, investment has risen 79%
to S$19 billion.This exodus of wealth is partly down
to President Xi Jinping launching a drivefor what he calls “common prosperity,”
a policy to redistribute wealth.In the past decade, the Chinese government
has tightened many regulations,and also we have seen many clampdowns
on various businesses.Also, the strenuous restrictions
during the pandemic also promptedmany Chinese
to leave home in search of a safer place.Why Singapore?Chinese Mandarin is one of the four
official languages.The majority of the ethnic groups
in Singaporeare Chinese people.Signs of Chinese
wealth are all over Singapore,from high-end clubs
to car dealerships and even golf clubs.Singapore has always beenof great attraction to the ultra-rich.It is not just Chinese that have flocked
to Singapore in recent years.You have people like Ray Dalio,
James Dyson,who have essentially set up family offices
here to come manage their wealth.It's instruments like these
that have been exploited and seen allegedcriminals find ways to deposit their money
in Singapore.Family offices are private, loosely
regulated companiesset up by the ultra-rich to manage
 their investments.In the same time period that China started
its strict pandemic lockdowns,the number of single-family offices
in Singapore tripled.It is a business that the Singapore government
has promoted over the yearsand set up ecosystem like lawyers, banks
to support family offices.Of course, when you have a lot of money
flowing in, no matter how strictthe regulation is,
some bad apples do flow in.What do we know about the
 ten alleged criminals?Some of them have been on
China's wanted listsince 2015 or 2016 for onlinegambling operations,
which is illegal in China.All of them came to Singaporein the past few years
to basically set up businesses here.Some suspects
say that they have been advisedto set up a family office
as a means to stay in Singapore.Many suspects also set up companies.What one can do is to hirea local citizen or a permanent residentto be a director
and a secretary to the company.For a few of these accused,
they had a corporate secretarywho essentially had a few
hundred businesses under their names.During the process of our investigations,
we found a companythat can help you to set up
a business in Singapore within 24 hours.Officials are examining whether loopholes
or weaknessesin the system allowed the suspects
to move their money to Singapore.When they arrived, they didn't exactly
live modest or quiet lives.All of these suspects lived in
highly coveted real estate in Singapore.We are talking about places
that are the equivalent of Mayfair in Londonor Central Park in New York.All the charges brought againstthe suspects
related to money laundering and forgery.So far, none of them have been convicted
of a crimeAnd some have said they
will fight the charges in court.We had to be very careful, 
we had to be very discreet.Keep it small, but examine the linksand then move in so that the money doesn't
move out of Singapore.We do have evidence that shows clearly
when they brought the money in.There were forged documents being used
to justify the provenance of the funds.After the arrest,the government said they are setting up
an inter-ministerial committeeto look whether there are gaps
in any part of the governmentthat allowed illicit money
to come to Singapore.The international connectedness, diversityand debt of our financial ecosystemalso makes us attractive to criminals
who will seek to exploitthese very qualities to hide their tracks
and launder their ill gotten gains.That is something that is faced
not just by Singapore, but by all majorfinancial centers and S$2.8 billion
was seized across a whole ecosystem, right?And of which I think about
S$1.5 billionwas also foundin the financial services sector.So we have to ask ourselves,
what can we do better?Questions are also being asked about
who might have enabledthe movement of allegedly tainted money.The suspects had held funds
in more than ten financial institutionsin Singapore, including major Western
banks, Credit Suisse and Citigroup.As one of the leading international
financial centers in the world,the daily transactions
in Singapore are voluminous.If we make the rules too tight,
then it is the vastmajority of innocent applicants
who will be unnecessarily penalized.As far as my system is concerned,the system is clean,the system did what it was supposed to do.If my system had been corrupted - - Then you'd be trouble.
- Then I'm in trouble.The central question
for not just Singapore, but any financial hubis how much is the cost
and how much is the risk that you arewilling to take in order
to attract the wealthyand businesses while at the same time
maintaining the amount of safeguardsin order to deter potential
illegality from coming in?
