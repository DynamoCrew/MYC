USUALLY THIS IS A THING
BANKS WOULD DO IF THEY WANTMORE ATTRITION.
BUT IT’S A TIME OF TRANSITION.SO HOW UNUSUAL AND PERHAPS WHAT
DOES THE TIMING SAY ABOUT THIS?>> I THINK THAT’S EXACTLY THE
TENSION THAT’S REALLYINTERESTING HERE, IS THIS IS A
BANK THAT HAS BEEN VERY VOCALABOUT WANTING TO REBUILD AFTER
LOSING A LOT OF ITS TOPINVESTMENT BANKERS EARLY LAST
YEAR.SO TO NOW COME BACK WITH THE
BONUS SEASON THAT’S ESPECIALLYBRUTAL, IT REALLY DOES HURT
MORALE AND OBVIOUSLY RISKSEVERYTHING THAT THEY’VE BEEN
TRYING TO DO WITH THIS REBUILD.SO DEFINITELY A DEPARTURE FROM
WHAT YOU NORMALLY SEE.IT’S NOT UNUSUAL FOR BANKS TO
GIVE OUT THEY’RE CALLEDDOUGHNUTS OR BAGELS IN WALL
STREET LINGO BUT IT’S DONESPARINGLY AND DONE TO FOLKS WHO
YOU KIND OF WANT TO SEE OUT THEDOOR.
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THIS ALOTS OF BANKERS GIVEN THESE
BAGELS AND SO REALLYINTERESTING TIME FOR THIS BANK
TO TRY TO CONTINUE WITH ITSREBUILD.>> THE TWO PEOPLE RUNNING THAT
SIDE OF THE BUSINESS, ACCORDINGTO OUR SOURCES, THEY WENT IN TO
THEIR TEAMS AND THEY HELD ON TOTHE RAIN MAKERS, THEY PAID UP
AND LIVED LARGE, EXCUSE THE PUN.BUT THEY SPENT PART OF THE PIE
RETAINING STAR TALENT.WHICH IS A FAIR ENOUGH STRATEGY.
BUT THAT MEANS, THAT BREEDSRESENTMENT.
I’VE WORKED ON FLOORS WHERETHAT REALLY BREEDS RESENTMENT
AND PEOPLE LEAVE.YOU DO NEED THE MID TIER TO
DELIVER IRONICALLY ENOUGH.RAIN MAKERS ARE WONDERFUL BUT
YOU NEED WORKER BEES AS WELL.>> I THINK THAT’S EXACTLY RIGHT.
AND THAT IS TO YOUR POINT WHATOUR SOURCES WERE TELLING US.
ALL THE EFFORTS TO REBUILD ANDNOT JUST RETAIN FOLKS BUT GO
OUT AND HIRE FOLKS.THOSE EFFORTS WORKED.
THEY WERE ABLE TO ADD DOZENS OFMANAGING DIRECTORS AND
DIRECTORS BUT NOW AT THE END OFTHE YEAR KIND OF WHEN THE
RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD YOU SEETHAT IS POTENTIALLY GOING TO
COMPLICATE THE FOLKS WHODECIDED TO STAY.
AND IT COULD ULTIMATELY REALLYUNDERMINE WHAT THEY’VE BEEN
ABLE TO DO.>> IF REASONING IS THE BANK
STRUGGLING, I LOVE WHAT THE IRSAID, THERE’S NOT QUITE ENOUGH
VOLATILITY FOR THE MARKETS BUTA LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR BANKING.
SO IT’S THIS AWKWARD PERIOD OFVOLATILITY NOT HELPING EITHER
SIDE.WE GET AN INVESTOR UPDATE LATER
THIS MONTH.ARE WE FINALLY IN THE SWEET
SPOT?>> I THINK THAT’S WHAT EVERYONE
IS HOPING FOR.SO THIS UPDATE WHAT THEY’VE
TALKED ABOUT IS THEY’REPLANNING TO SAY THE INVESTMENT
BANK GETS A LOT OF FLACKBECAUSE IT TAKES UP SO MUCH
CAPITAL RELATIVE TO OTHER PARTSOF THE BANK.
THEY LOVE THEIR INVESTMENT BANK.THEY THINK IT’S A REALLY HIGH
PERFORMING UNIT.THEY WANT TO KEEP IT.
SO I THINK THEIR GOAL NOW IS TOREBALANCE THAT AND INVEST IN
OTHER PARTS OF THE BANK.SO WE SAW THIS MORNING
BARCLAY’S ANNOUNCED THEY AREBUYING TESCO, SO YOU SEE THEM
TRYING TO MAKE THESE STEPSWHERE THEY WON’T DEEMPHASIZE OR
PULL BACK BUT THEY’LL MAKE THEOTHER PARTS OF THE BANK BIGGER
AND THAT WAY THE SHARE OF THECOMPANY THAT THE INVESTMENT
BANK TAKES UP ISN’T AS LARGEAND THAT HELPS A LOT ON THE
CAPITAL FRONT.SO I THINK WE’LL SEE MORE
MANEUVERING LIKE THAT BECAUSEEVERYTHING THEY’VE SAID IS THEY
WANT TO SEE IT GROW.
