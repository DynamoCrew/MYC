## Introduction: 

Introducing our solution: the My YouTube Companion (MYC). With over 2.49 billion users on YouTube and 47% of them engaging with the platform each month, it's evident that YouTube has become an indispensable tool for learning. However, navigating through the vast sea of content can be daunting, especially when encountering unfamiliar terminology. 
Research shows that over 70% of YouTube users watch videos specifically to learn something new. However, the process of pausing the video, conducting a Google search, and deciphering complex terms disrupts the flow of learning and can lead to frustration.
To address this challenge, our team has developed a revolutionary website add-on. The YouTube Learning Companion seamlessly integrates with your browsing experience, providing real-time assistance as you watch educational videos. 
Here's how it works: as the video plays, the companion reads along with the transcript. Whenever it encounters finance terminology, it automatically provides a clear definition and offers real-life examples to illustrate the concept. This innovative tool eliminates the need for interruptions, allowing users to stay focused and engaged with the content.
Imagine watching a tutorial on stock market analysis and effortlessly understanding terms like "dividends," "capital gains," or "market volatility" without ever leaving the video window. With MYC, learning from YouTube becomes not only easier but also more enriching and enjoyable. Empower yourself with knowledge and unlock the full potential of YouTube as a learning platform. Try the My YouTube Companion today and embark on a journey of seamless and immersive learning experiences.

## How it works: 

MYC, or the YouTube Companion, functions as an add-on integrated with the YouTube platform. When users encounter unfamiliar terminology, content, or concepts while watching a video, MYC offers an efficient solution. Here's how it works:

- MYC appears as an icon on the right side of the YouTube video player when the user is in the Default view.
- Users can access MYC without interrupting their video playback; there's no need to pause the video.
- By clicking on the MYC icon, users instantly receive quick, accurate, and concise information related to the unfamiliar term or concept being discussed in the video.
- This eliminates the need for users to spend time pausing the video, opening a new browser tab, typing in their query, and searching for the most suitable definition or explanation.
- MYC streamlines the learning process by providing on-the-spot assistance, ensuring that users can swiftly grasp new information without disruptions or delays.

In addition to its core functionality, MYC offers further interaction through two buttons located at the bottom of the interface. These buttons are:

- "I understand": Clicking this button indicates that the user has comprehended the provided information. Selecting this option closes MYC and allows the user to continue watching the video without interruption.
- "Need more information": Choosing this option prompts MYC to provide additional assistance. It offers examples and attempts to define the unfamiliar term or concept in alternative ways, catering to various learning preferences and levels of understanding. This feature ensures that users can delve deeper into the topic if desired, enriching their learning experience directly within the YouTube environment.
